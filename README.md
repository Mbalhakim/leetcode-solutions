# Leetcode Solutions

This is a **Next.js** project that provides a platform for solving Leetcode problems. The app allows users to view problems, explore their solutions, and view explanations for various algorithms and data structures. It aims to help developers and learners understand how to approach and solve common coding challenges.

## Features
- View problems with their descriptions and constraints.
- View code implementations and explanations for each problem.
- Problem categorization by topics like algorithms and data structures.
- Supports themes and UI customization.
- Responsive design for easy use across different devices.

## Getting Started

First, clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/leetcode-solutions.git
cd leetcode-solutions
npm install

# Run localy
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying app/page.tsx. The page will auto-update as you edit the file.
```

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **`app/`**: Contains pages and layout for the app, including the problem-solving interface.
- **`components/`**: Reusable components like code display, explanations, footer, and theme toggle.
- **`data/`**: Problem data and configurations.
- **`public/`**: Static assets like icons and images.
- **`types/`**: TypeScript types for better type safety.
